# Responsive Website Fix Prompt for Replit

**Project Context:** My website is already built but has significant responsiveness issues. Please analyze the entire codebase and refactor it for a flawless mobile and desktop experience.

**Primary Goal:** Achieve complete responsiveness without horizontal scrolling on the main viewport, except where explicitly intended for data tables.

## Specific Requirements:

### 1. Horizontal Scrolling Prevention
- **Main pages must NOT scroll horizontally** on mobile screens
- Ensure viewport width is constrained to `100vw`
- Fix any elements causing overflow beyond viewport boundaries

### 2. Flexible Layout Management
- Make flex/grid containers use `flex-wrap: wrap`
- Items should automatically wrap to next rows on small screens
- Maintain proper spacing and alignment when wrapped

### 3. Data Table Handling
- Keep tables with many columns **horizontally scrollable**
- Wrap each table in a container with `overflow-x: auto`
- Ensure only the table scrolls, not the entire page

### 4. Mobile Navigation Fix
- Current left-side nav is invisible on mobile
- Implement hamburger menu that works on all pages
- Menu should be accessible and toggleable
- Ensure smooth animation and proper positioning

### 5. Modal/Popup Containment
- All modals must fit within viewport boundaries
- Use `max-width: 100vw` and `max-height: 100vh`
- Prevent cutting off or overflow on any device

### 6. Content Centering
- Center all main content horizontally
- Use Flexbox/Grid for proper centering
- No content should be stuck to left/right edges

## Technical Implementation:
- **Approach:** Mobile-first CSS with media queries
- **Units:** Use relative units (`%`, `rem`, `vw/vh`)
- **Layout:** Flexbox/Grid with proper wrapping
- **Testing:** Verify on multiple screen sizes

## Files to Audit:
- All HTML files
- CSS stylesheets (main and component-specific)
- JavaScript for interactive elements (modals, navigation)
- Any framework-specific component files

**Priority:** Fix horizontal scrolling and mobile navigation first, then proceed with other responsiveness issues.
