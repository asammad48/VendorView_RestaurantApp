# Bluetooth Printer Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Bluetooth printer functionality has been successfully integrated into the SignalR service. When a new order is created, the system will automatically attempt to print a receipt if a Bluetooth printer is connected.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Bluetooth Printer Service
**File:** `client/src/services/bluetoothPrinterService.ts`

**Added comprehensive console logging throughout:**
- Connection process logging with step-by-step details
- Device selection and GATT server connection logs
- Service and characteristic discovery logs
- Print job progress with chunk-by-chunk tracking
- Detailed error logging with error names and messages
- Connection status checks with logged results

**Log Prefix:** All logs use `[Bluetooth Printer]` prefix with emoji indicators:
- üîå Connection operations
- üñ®Ô∏è Print operations
- ‚úÖ Success states
- ‚ùå Error states
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning states

### 2. SignalR Service Integration
**File:** `client/src/services/signalRService.ts`

**Changes made:**
1. Imported `bluetoothPrinterService`
2. Enhanced the `OrderCreated` event handler to:
   - Log detailed event information
   - Check if Bluetooth printer is connected
   - Automatically print receipt if printer is available
   - Show toast notifications for print success/failure
   - Gracefully handle cases when printer is not connected

**Log Prefix:** All logs use `[SignalR]` prefix

## How It Works

### When an Order is Created via SignalR:

1. **Event Received**
   ```
   [SignalR] OrderCreated event received
   [SignalR] Event details: { orderId, orderNumber, timestamp }
   ```

2. **Toast Notification Shown**
   - User sees: "New Order Created! üéâ"

3. **Printer Check**
   ```
   [SignalR] Checking if Bluetooth printer is connected...
   [Bluetooth Printer] Connection status check: true/false
   ```

4. **If Printer Connected:**
   ```
   [SignalR] ‚úÖ Bluetooth printer is connected, attempting to print...
   [Bluetooth Printer] üñ®Ô∏è Print receipt requested
   [Bluetooth Printer] Building ESC/POS receipt...
   [Bluetooth Printer] Receipt data encoded: XXX bytes
   [Bluetooth Printer] Sending chunk 1/N (512 bytes)
   [Bluetooth Printer] Sending chunk 2/N (512 bytes)
   ...
   [Bluetooth Printer] ‚úÖ Receipt printed successfully!
   [SignalR] ‚úÖ Receipt printed successfully via Bluetooth!
   ```
   - User sees: "Receipt Printed! üñ®Ô∏è"

5. **If Printer Not Connected:**
   ```
   [SignalR] ‚ö†Ô∏è Bluetooth printer not connected, skipping print
   [SignalR] To enable automatic printing, connect a Bluetooth printer from the Printer page
   ```

## Browser Console Logs

All printer-related activity is logged to the browser console with clear, prefixed messages. You can:

1. **Open Chrome DevTools** (F12 or right-click > Inspect)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Filter by "[Bluetooth Printer]" or "[SignalR]"** to see relevant logs

### Example Log Output:

```
[SignalR] OrderCreated event received: {orderId: 123, orderNumber: "ORD-001"}
[SignalR] Event details: {orderId: 123, orderNumber: "ORD-001", timestamp: "2025-10-19T17:38:00.000Z"}
[SignalR] Checking if Bluetooth printer is connected...
[Bluetooth Printer] Connection status check: true
[SignalR] ‚úÖ Bluetooth printer is connected, attempting to print receipt...
[Bluetooth Printer] üñ®Ô∏è Print receipt requested
[Bluetooth Printer] Order data: {orderNumber: "ORD-001", itemCount: 1, total: 0}
[Bluetooth Printer] Building ESC/POS receipt...
[Bluetooth Printer] Receipt data encoded: 456 bytes
[Bluetooth Printer] Sending data to printer...
[Bluetooth Printer] Sending chunk 1/1 (456 bytes)
[Bluetooth Printer] ‚úÖ Receipt printed successfully!
[SignalR] ‚úÖ Receipt printed successfully via Bluetooth!
```

## Browser Support

**Supported Browsers:**
- ‚úÖ Chrome (Desktop & Android)
- ‚úÖ Edge (Desktop & Android)
- ‚úÖ Opera (Desktop & Android)

**Not Supported:**
- ‚ùå Safari (all platforms)
- ‚ùå Firefox
- ‚ùå Internet Explorer

## Testing

### To Test the Implementation:

1. **Connect a Bluetooth Printer:**
   - Go to the Printer page in your app
   - Click "Connect Bluetooth Printer"
   - Select your BLE thermal printer from the list

2. **Open Browser Console:**
   - Press F12 or right-click > Inspect
   - Go to Console tab

3. **Trigger an Order Creation:**
   - Create a new order through your app
   - Watch the console for detailed logs

4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Console logs show the complete flow
   - Receipt prints automatically if printer is connected
   - Toast notifications appear for success/failure

### If Things Break:

**All errors are logged to the console with details:**

```
[Bluetooth Printer] ‚ùå Connection error: Error message here
[Bluetooth Printer] Error details: {message: "...", name: "..."}
```

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Web Bluetooth API not available"**
   - Solution: Use Chrome, Edge, or Opera browser

2. **"Printer not connected"**
   - Solution: Connect printer from the Printer page first

3. **"Print failed"**
   - Check console logs for specific error
   - Verify printer is still connected (Bluetooth range)
   - Try reconnecting the printer

## Receipt Format

The printed receipt includes:
- **Restaurant/Branch name** header (centered, large font)
- **Order number** and date/time
- **Items list** with actual menu items:
  - Item name (with variant if applicable)
  - Quantity
  - Unit price (formatted with branch currency)
  - Deal packages marked with [DEAL] prefix
- **Complete price breakdown:**
  - Subtotal (formatted with branch currency)
  - Delivery charges (if applicable)
  - Service charges (if applicable)
  - Tax (if applicable)
  - Tip (if applicable)
  - Discount (shown as negative, if applicable)
  - **TOTAL** (bold, larger font, formatted with branch currency)
- **Allergens section** (if order contains allergens):
  - Bold "ALLERGENS:" header
  - Comma-separated list of allergen names
- **"Thank you" footer** (centered)
- **Automatic paper cut**

### Currency Support

The receipt automatically formats all prices using the branch's currency:
- **USD**: $10.00
- **PKR**: ‚Ç®10.00
- **EUR**: ‚Ç¨10.00
- **GBP**: ¬£10.00
- **INR**: ‚Çπ10.00

## ‚úÖ UPDATED: Full Order Details Integration

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

The system now automatically:
1. ‚úÖ Fetches complete order data from `/api/orders/{orderId}` when OrderCreated event is received
2. ‚úÖ Fetches branch details from `/api/branches/{branchId}` to get currency
3. ‚úÖ Prints actual menu items with names, quantities, and prices
4. ‚úÖ Includes deal packages marked with [DEAL] prefix
5. ‚úÖ Uses branch currency for all price formatting (USD, PKR, EUR, GBP, INR, etc.)
6. ‚úÖ Shows all charges: delivery, service, tax, tip, discount
7. ‚úÖ Displays allergens in a dedicated section on the receipt

## GATT Error Fixes (Latest Update)

**Problem:** Some laptops experienced GATT errors causing printer disconnection during print jobs.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Reduced Chunk Size**: Changed from 512 bytes to 128 bytes per write operation
   - More conservative chunk size prevents buffer overflow
   - Better compatibility with various printer models

2. **Increased Delays**: Extended delay from 50ms to 100ms between chunks
   - Gives printer buffer more time to process data
   - Prevents overwhelming slower devices

3. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**:
   - Each chunk write has 3 retry attempts
   - Exponential backoff: 200ms, 400ms, 800ms between retries
   - Automatic reconnection if connection is lost mid-print

4. **Connection Monitoring**:
   - Added `gattserverdisconnected` event listener
   - Automatic connection status updates
   - Graceful handling of unexpected disconnections

5. **Per-Chunk Error Handling**:
   - Each chunk write is wrapped in try-catch
   - Connection verification before each write
   - Detailed error logging with error codes

### Console Logs for GATT Errors:

```
[Bluetooth Printer] Sending chunk 5/10 (128 bytes)
[Bluetooth Printer] ‚ö†Ô∏è Attempt 1/3 failed for chunk 5/10: GATT operation failed
[Bluetooth Printer] Retrying in 200ms...
[Bluetooth Printer] ‚úÖ Chunk 5/10 sent successfully on attempt 2
```

## Files Modified
