Key capabilities include dynamic page routing, mobile responsiveness, subscription plan integration, comprehensive orders and menu management (including deals and services), ticket reporting, user management, and advanced analytics. Recent additions include a full inventory management system with stock tracking, low stock monitoring, purchase order capabilities, stock wastage tracking with date-filtered historical viewing, and expense management with utility expense tracking.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Technical preferences:
- Integrate real API endpoints for user management with proper authentication
- Implement generic pagination system with configurable page sizes
- User table: Only keep name search filter, remove all other search filters
- Use FormData format for user creation with profile pictures
- Password field should have show/hide toggle functionality
- API integration: Users list API with name filtering and pagination support
- Generic pagination configuration stored in centralized location
- Real-time API integration with proper error handling and loading states

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite.
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives and shadcn/ui.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state.
- **Authentication**: Custom auth context with localStorage persistence.
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization.

### Data Management (Frontend-Only with External APIs)
- **Architecture**: Pure client-side React application with real API integration.
- **External API Integration**: Generic API repository pattern for all external API calls, handling 400/401/403/404/422/500 status codes.
- **Data Storage**: localStorage for session management and authentication tokens.
- **Real API Integration**: Users API, Roles API, Entities/Branches API with proper authentication.
- **Pagination System**: Generic pagination utilities with configurable page sizes (5, 10, 20, 50, 100).
- **Server-Side Pagination**: All inventory management tables support server-side pagination with query parameters (PageNumber, PageSize, SortBy, IsAscending, SearchTerm). Frontend is ready to consume PaginationResponse structure from backend.
- **PaginationResponse Handling**: All inventory endpoints (Categories, Items, Suppliers, Stock, Low Stock, Purchase Orders, Wastage, Utility Expenses, Recipes) use defensive data extraction pattern: `Array.isArray(data) ? data : (data as any)?.items || []` to support both direct array responses and PaginationResponse<T> format with backward compatibility.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Strategy**: Username/password authentication with role-based access.
- **Roles**: Manager, Waiter, Chef with distinct permissions.
- **Session Persistence**: localStorage for client-side session management.
- **Protected Routes**: Route-level protection with authentication checks.

### Core Features & Design
- **Unified Entity Management**: Supports both hotels and restaurants.
- **File Upload**: Image-only file upload for profile/certificate pictures (Base64 encoding, FormData for API).
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Full responsive design across all components.
- **Comprehensive Management Systems**: Includes Orders, Menu (with CRUD, add-ons, customizations), Deals, Services, Tickets, User, Inventory (Categories, Suppliers, Items, Stock, Purchase Orders, Stock Wastage), and Expense Management (Utility Expenses).
- **Inventory Management Search**: All inventory tables include search functionality with search bars for filtering by name/relevant field. Search queries are sent as SearchTerm query parameter to the API.
- **User Management**: Add/Edit User modal with profile pictures, role, and branch assignment, with real API integration and name-only search filtering.
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Sales summary, item performance, occupancy, peak hours, customer feedback with date range toggles and 7 specialized categories.
- **Appearance Customization**: Gradient color picker for real-time UI previews.
- **Card Design**: Attractive entity and branch cards with gradient overlays, hover effects, and animated buttons.
- **Advanced MenuItem Management**: Enhanced Add/Edit MenuItem modal with API-based modifier section using SubMenuItems with multi-select functionality.
